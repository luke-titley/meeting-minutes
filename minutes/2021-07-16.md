- Onboarding PR for OpenEXR bindings are done and merged. https://github.com/vfx-rs/openexr-bind/pull/32
- We need to create an issue to transfer the license from Apache-2 to BSD 3 clause in order for the OpenEXR project to accept the bindings.
- The next big project to start is the USD bindings because they're going to take a long time to complete.
- We need to finalize the OpenEXR bindings, and set up a CI.
