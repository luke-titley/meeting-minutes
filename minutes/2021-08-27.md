Previous Action Items
=====================

- CI Server: Create a simple Ubuntu image that we can run `cargo test` on and pass.
- OpenEXR bindings: Sort out what still needs to be done before we hand off the bindings over to the OpenEXR project. Would need to communicate with the OpenEXR project.

Topics
======

- CI status
- OpenEXR bindings ownership status
  - Close to ready to release with Windows and Linux support. Approx in 1 week. Need to update documentation on Linux/Windows support with special note for CentOS 7 support.
  - Investigate merging the sys crate in with the high level API. We may not need it, and organizing both crates is a challenge, but need to see what happens when we merge the crates.
  - Investigate the project structure of the OpenEXR bindings (repo per API/sys/C API, everything all in one, etc).
  - Need to create a check list of what we need to do before handing off the project to the OpenEXR project.
- OpenImageIO status
  - Bindings are generated, and almost everything except the ImageBufAlgo is coded. Docs and tests needed.
- Add David Aguilar as a maintainer for the ptex crate.
- USD
  - Anders and Luke may have time to start on a minimal viable product.
  - Need to decide on a project owner, and decide if this is something we'll tackle soon.
