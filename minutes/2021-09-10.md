Previous Action Items
=====================

- Need to gather a list of items to do before handing over the OpenEXR bindings to the OpenEXR Project
- Release Windows and Linux support of the OpenEXR bindings
- Investigate changing the layout of the OpenEXR crates. Maybe drop the sys crate.
- Add David Aguilar as a maintainer for the ptex crate.
- Find a project owner for the USD bindings.

Topics
======

- CI: Tiago is experimenting with creating the CI Docker image. It is being rebuilt every time, so need to talk with the CI Working Group to get some beta images on Docker Hub.
- Ptex: David should have access to the ptex GitHub repo. He has a PR ready that should get Ander's eyes on to make sure it conforms to our standard. But, from Scott's point of view, as long as it builds the C and Rust -sys layers, and the naming/structure matches what we did in OpenEXR, it should be okay.

Action Items
============

- CI: Tiago set up a Docker Hub account for the CI image building.
