Previous Action Items
=====================

- CI: Tiago set up a Docker Hub account for the CI image building.

Topics
======

- Moving bindings over to OpenEXR
- Creating announcement for Rust WG
- CI: Tiago has a new job, so needs to get a CLA. We need to make sure that the CI has the crates.io publish keys for when we version up the crate. Also, need to either cache or create a docker container for cppmm, otherwise building it takes about 20 minutes of our CI time.
- "Unsafe +": Due to time and resource limits, we may not be able to create safe and generic interfaces for all of the underlying C++ code. So, for those APIs, we could create a "minimally safe", but still technically unsafe interface. If we do this, we should ticket it up and document it as something that may be worth investigating making safe. Releasing these "unsafe+" interfaces might be okay for the 0.x releases, but the "1.0" release might need to have those wrapped or left unsafe. This discussion should probably be made with the project we're binding (for example, OpenEXR).

Action Items
============

- Should we mark unsafe, but not really unsafe APIs as safe or unsafe? Anders is going to create a GitHub issues to start the discussion
- Investigate if we should have a separate `-sys` crate, or keep everything in a single crate.
