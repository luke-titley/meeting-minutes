- Subgroup reports: Since we have people interested in making bindings, we should consider creating sub-groups to organize those bindings.
- OpenEXR bindings push: We need to clean the repo and make sure it is all good and ready to hand over to the OpenEXR project. Depending on schedules, we may want to delay the hand off to end of March.
- Template project: Scott needs a hand with getting the example binding to work in the repo. Then we can add CI and clean up the repo to be a project template for projects going forward.
- OpenTimelineIO: First commit to the bindings. There's some questions on how to get the bindings set up, so Scott will set up a call with Sergio to get things going.
